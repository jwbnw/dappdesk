# DappDesk ノ( º \_ º ノ)

Dapp Desk is a Web Based Application Aggregator and Address Explorer for Dapps on the Solana Blockchain. The project is still in early development at the moment having been inspired by the Solana Season Hackathon. Check back soon for updates and info on when we release to prod!

## Visit the Beta

We're currently hosting the Hackathon Beta on github pages: <a href="https://jwbnw.github.io/dappdesk/#/"> Visit Dapp Desk Beta </a>

### Building it yourself

If you want to build the project locally here is how.

-- Assuming you already have Node.js installed (<a href="https://nodejs.org">if not click here to download and find documentation on how to do so</a>) --

```
1) Clone/Fork the Repo
```

```
2) Navigate to the root directory of dappdesk and run: npm install
```

```
3) Navigate to the root directory of dappdesk and run: npm run dev
```

```
4) This should open up a browser window at localhost:9000 with hot reloading
```

If you run into any build issues ensure you have all dependencies installed then raise an issue and I'll see if I can lend a hand!
